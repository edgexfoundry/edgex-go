Getting Started
###############

To get started you need to obtain EdgeX Foundry either as a User or as a Developer. See Working in a Hybrid Environment if you are developing or working in a micro service in Eclipse but want to run the other micro services via Docker Containers. As a developer, if you intend to connect IoT objects (device, sensor or other "thing") that are not currently connected to EdgeX Foundry, you may also want to obtain the Software Development Kit (SDK) that creates scaffolding for a new EdgeX Foundry Device Service.
