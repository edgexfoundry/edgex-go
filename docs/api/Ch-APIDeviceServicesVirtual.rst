Introduction
============

The Virtual Device Service simulates different kinds of devices to generate Events and Readings to Core Data Microservice and Users can send commands and get responses through the Command and Control Microservice. The ability to do these activities is very useful when executing functional or performance tests without any real devices. This version of Virtual Device Service is implemented based on the Device Service SDK.
