Introduction
============

EdgeX Foundry Core Data Service includes the device and sensor collected data database and APIs to expose the database to other services as well as north-bound integration. The database is secure. Direct access to the database is restricted to the Core Data service APIs. Core Data also provides the REST API to create and register a new device.
