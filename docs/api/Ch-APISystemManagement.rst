The EdgeX System Management Agent (SMA) exposes the EdgeX management service API to 3rd party systems.  In other words, the Agent serves as a proxy for system management service API calls into each micro service.  In the future, the SMA may also offer the management API in other remote management/control system protocols like LWM2M, OMA DM, etc.
