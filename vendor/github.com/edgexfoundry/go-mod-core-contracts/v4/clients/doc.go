Package clients provides REST-based integration with the core APIs of the EdgeX Foundry platform.

Each individual service client can be found in its respective package within clients. View the Subdirectories section
below for more information.

While it is certainly possible to utilize the exported functions in this package to make calls to a given service, it
is recommended (unless you really specifically know what you're doing) to use the service clients instead. The functions
here are exported primarily for the use of the service clients.
