# This TOML file now incorporates a now-defunct manifest file, which had specified the services managed by the SMA.
# The SMA needs the details provided in this TOML to stop/start/restart each service that the SMA manages.
# What about specifying the edgexsecurity service to use?
# Different versions of this manifest may exist depending on how/where EdgeX is deployed (Docker v. Snappy, Windows v. Linux, etc.).
# In the first release of the SMA, the manifest will be static.
# In the future, the manifest may be more dynamic or even provided by some 3rd party orchestrator.

# The preceding line (i.e. '/path/to/the/file') is a placeholder that needs to be populated.
# ExecutorPath = '/sys-mgmt-executor'

MetricsMechanism = 'custom/executor/direct-service'
# The preceding line (i.e. 'custom/executor/direct-service') is a placeholder that needs to be populated.
# The MetricsMechanism setting can be one of the following three options, starting with custom mechanism (e.g. snap) to
# fetch metrics, and from which one should be used to populate the MetricsMechanism setting:
# MetricsMechanism = 'custom'
# MetricsMechanism = 'executor'
# MetricsMechanism = 'direct-service'
