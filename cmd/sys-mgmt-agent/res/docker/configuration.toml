# This TOML file now incorporates a now-defunct manifest file, which had specified the services managed by the SMA.
# The SMA needs the details provided in this TOML to stop/start/restart each service that the SMA manages.
# What about specifying the edgexsecurity service to use?
# Different versions of this manifest may exist depending on how/where EdgeX is deployed (Docker v. Snappy, Windows v. Linux, etc.).
# In the first release of the SMA, the manifest will be static.
# In the future, the manifest may be more dynamic or even provided by some 3rd party orchestrator.
