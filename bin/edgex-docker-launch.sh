# Usage: bin/edgex-docker-launch.sh [redis]
#
# By default download the Mongo based Docker Compose file and attempt to start EdgeX. If the redis
# option is used, download the Redis based Docker Compose file and attemp to start EdgeX.
#
# To override the compose file entirely set the COMPOSE_FILE_PATH environment variable to the full
# pathname of the compose file you want to use.
