# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records document design choices that address a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.

This folder contains ADRs that impact the services contained in the edgex-go repo. Other EdgeX repos may have their own ADRs that only impact those components or services.

See  https://adr.github.io/  for more details on ADRs.
