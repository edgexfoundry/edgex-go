/* Redis ACL configuration
*
* The followings are some contents excerpted from Redis 6.0 online conf documentation
* regarding the ACL rules as seen in this https://redis.io/topics/acl#acl-rules:
*
# Redis ACL users are defined in the following format:
#
#   user <username> ... acl rules ...
#
# For example:
#
#   user worker +@list +@connection ~jobs:* on >ffa9203c493aa99
#
# The special username "default" is used for new connections. If this user
# has the "nopass" rule, then new connections will be immediately authenticated
# as the "default" user without the need of any password provided via the
# AUTH command. Otherwise if the "default" user is not flagged with "nopass"
# the connections will start in not authenticated state, and will require
# AUTH (or the HELLO command AUTH option) in order to be authenticated and
# start to work.
#
# The ACL rules that describe what a user can do are the following:
#
#  on           Enable the user: it is possible to authenticate as this user.
#  +@<category> Allow the execution of all the commands in such category
#               with valid categories are like @admin, @set, @sortedset, ...
#               and so forth, see the full list in the server.c file where
#               the Redis command table is described and defined.
#               The special category @all means all the commands, but currently
#               present in the server, and that will be loaded in the future
#               via modules.
#  allcommands  Alias for +@all. Note that it implies the ability to execute
#               all the future commands loaded via the modules system.
#  allkeys      Alias for ~*
#
# ACL rules can be specified in any order: for instance you can start with
# passwords, then flags, or key patterns. However note that the additive
# and subtractive rules will CHANGE MEANING depending on the ordering.
#
# Basically ACL rules are processed left-to-right.
#
# For more information about ACL configuration please refer to
# the Redis web site at https://redis.io/topics/acl
#
#
#
# Using an external ACL file
#
# Instead of configuring users here in this file, it is possible to use
# a stand-alone file just listing users. The two methods cannot be mixed:
# if you configure users here and at the same time you activate the external
# ACL file, the server will refuse to start.
#
# The format of the external ACL user file is exactly the same as the
# format that is used inside redis.conf to describe users.
#
# aclfile /etc/redis/users.acl
#
*
* For EdgeX's use case today, the ACL rules are defined in a template as seen in
* the following constant aclDefaultUserTemplate.
* In particular, it defines the ACL rule for default user with the following accesses:
*   1) allkeys: it allows the user to access all the keys
*   2) +@all: this is an alias for allcommands and + means to allow
*   3) -@dangerous: disallow all the commands that are tagged as dangerous inside the Redis command table
*   4) #{{.Sha256RedisPwd}}: add the dynamically injected SHA-256 hashed password for this user
*
* We do not use "requirepass" directive any more since hashed password already specified in the ACL rule
* for that user.
*
