% pki-init(1) Version 1.0 | PKI initialization for EdgeX Foundry secret management subsystem

NAME
====

**pki-init** â€” Creates an on-device public-key infrastructure (PKI) to secure microservice secret management

SYNOPSIS
========

| **pki-init** \[**-generate**|**-cache**|**-cacheca**|**-import**]
| **pki-init** \[**-h**|**--help**|**]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The Vault secret management component of EdgeX Foundry requires TLS encryption of secrets over the wire via a pre-created PKI.  In Docker-based installations of EdgeX Foundry, this component carries out the installation of a PKI that is for transport-level encryption of application secrets and is designed to run in its own microservice. pki-init supports several modes of operation as defined in the Options section.

As the PKI is security-sensitive this tool takes a number of precautions to safeguard the PKI:
* The underlying `pkisetup` utility is invoked to generate the PKI into a subfolder of $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, which is a non-persistent tmpfs volume.
* The resulting PKI is deployed on a per-service basis to /run/edgex/secrets/pki/_service-name_, which is assumed to also be a non-persistent tmpfs volume.
* The CA private key is shred (securely erased) prior to caching, if caching is wanted.

Options
-------

-h, --help

:   Prints brief usage information.

-generate

:   Causes a PKI to be generated afresh every time (typically, this will be whenever the framework is started).

-cache

:   Causes a PKI to be generated exactly once and then copied to a designated cache location for future use.  The private key of the CA certificate is not cached to deter unauthorized creation of additional end-entity TLS certificates.

-cacheca

:   Causes a PKI to be generated exactly once and then copied to a designated cache location for future use.  The private key of the CA certificate is cached as well to support the possibility of after-the-fact creation of new TLS end-entity certificates.

-import

:   Suppresses all PKI generation functionality and tells pki-init to assume that there is a Docker volume that the cache volume contains a pre-populated PKI such as a Kong certificate signed by an external certificate authority or TLS keys signed by an offline enterprise certificate authority.

FILES
=====

*/run/edgex/secrets/***

:   Target deployment folder for the PKI secrets. Populated with subdirectories named after EdgeX services (e.g. `edgex-vault`) and contains typically two files: `server.crt` for a PEM-encoded end-entity TLS certificate and the corresponding private key in `server.key` as well as a sentinel value `.pki-init.complete`.  The special service name "ca" is reserved for the CA certificate and private key.  

*pkisetup*

:   EdgeX utility application to generate a CA and TLS leaf certificates.  Expected to be in the working directory where `pki-init` is launched.

*pkisetup-vault.json*

:   Configuration file for `pkisetup` to generate Vault's PKI.  Expected to be in the working directory where `pki-init` is launched.

ENVIRONMENT
===========

**XDG_RUNTIME_DIR**

:   A runtime scratch area used for PKI generation.  The `pkisetup` utility is invoked into `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/edgex/pki-init/setup` and the reformatted and stored in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/edgex/pki-init/generated`

**PKI_CACHE**

:   If unspecified defaults to `/etc/edgex/pki` and should be mapped to a persistent Docker volume.  The `-cache` option caches PKI into here, and `-import` deploys a PKI from here.

NOTES
=====

As pki-init is a helper utility to ensure that a PKI is created on first launch, it is intended that pki-init is always invoked with the same operation flag, such as `-generate` or `-cache` or `-import`.   It is not possible to change from `-cache` to `-cacheca` or vice-versa (the tool will detect this and output a warning).  Changing from `-cache` to `-generate` will cause the cache to be ignored when deploying a PKI and changing it back will cause a reversion to a stale CA.  Changing from `-cache` to `-import` mode of operation is not noticeable by the tool--the PKI that is in the cache will be the one deployed.  To force regeneration of the PKI cache after the first launch, the PKI cache must be manually cleaned.
