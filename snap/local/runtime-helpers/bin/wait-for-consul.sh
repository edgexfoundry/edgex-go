# is fixed, on install services startup is not guaranteed in the right order
# and as such, we need to do a little bit of hand holding for the go services,
# which only have 10 seconds for consul to come alive, but on some systems
# it can be more than 10 seconds until consul comes alive in which case
# the services will fail to startup 
# this gives consul 50 seconds to come up
