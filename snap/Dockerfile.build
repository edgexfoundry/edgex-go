# this is essentially the same as the upstream dockerfile
# here: https://github.com/snapcore/snapcraft/blob/master/docker/stable.Dockerfile
# except we also specify the architecture to download so that this works
# on other architectures
# basically, we send a command to the snap store for the info on the core +
# snapcraft snaps, extract the download link from the result and 
# download and extract the snaps into the docker container
# we do this because we can't easily run snapd (and thus snaps) inside a docker
# container without disabling important security protections enabled for 
# docker containers

# the upstream dockerfile just uses this file locally from the repo, but 
# rather than copy that file here, we can just download it here
# while unlikely it is possible that the file location could move in the git repo
# on master branch, so for stability in our builds, we just hard-code the git 
# commit that most recently updated this file as the revision to download from
# if this ever breaks, just change this file to copy what the upstream master dockerfile does
