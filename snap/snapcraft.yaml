summary: Open-source framework for IoT edge computing
description: |
  EdgeX Foundry is a vendor-neutral open source project hosted by The Linux 
  Foundation building a common open framework for IoT edge computing. This 
  snap contains all of the EdgeX core, security, and support reference 
  services, as well as Consul, Kong, MongoDB, Vault, a JRE for the two 
  remaining Java services, and a set of basic device services. The packaging 
  for this snap can be found at: https://github.com/edgexfoundry/edgex-go

# Different epochs prevent refreshes between major versions of EdgeX due
# to continued configuration changes.

epoch: 3

# TODO: add armhf here when that's supported
architectures:
  - build-on: arm64
  - build-on: amd64

# for start-timeout, we need snapd 2.38
# we need command-chain for the hooks too
assumes: [snapd2.42, command-chain]

# Ideally snapcraft would generate this command-chain spec for the hooks
# automatically, but that doesn't currently work, see
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapd/+bug/1824255
# In the meantime, make sure that the snapcraft-runner gets generated by
# the apps by specifying the full adapter in at least one of the apps, and
# manually craft the command-chain for the configure hook here to passthrough
# to the snap.yaml
# All of this is necessary so we can use jq and other tools from inside the
# snap in the configure and install hooks
# See also https://bugs.launchpad.net/snapcraft/+bug/1848381 for specifying
# environment for hooks
