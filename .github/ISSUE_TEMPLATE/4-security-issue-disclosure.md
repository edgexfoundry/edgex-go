The EdgeX Foundry project practices responsible disclosure. Since GitHub issues are public, 
instead of reporting the issue through GitHub, please email our security issues team at 
edgex-tsc-security@lists.edgexfoundry.org with details on your environment, expected behavior, 
how this is a security issue and any applicable exploits or associated CVE's if this issue is 
related to any previously reported CVE.

For full details please read the "Security Issue Reporting Process" located at 
https://wiki.edgexfoundry.org/display/FA/Security+Working+Group on how to disclose security related issues.
