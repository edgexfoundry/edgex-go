  title: Edgex Foundry - Support Logging API
  description: This is the definition of the API for the Support Logging service in the EdgeX Foundry IOT microservice platform. Support Logging provides functionality to other services for use in logging. In the case where a client service isn't simply writing its logs to a file, it can make a call to Support Logging which then serves as an abstraction around the eventual persistence method for logs -- file, database, etc.
